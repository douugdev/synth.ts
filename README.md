# A digital synthesizer and DAW in your browser!

## Why?

Even simple DAWs are heavy and costly, with wave modulation you can basically create any sound and song, so
a browser DAW is here to save the day, currently a WIP but that's the spirit of the project.

## State

Pre-pre-alpha, a lot of bugs and contributions are welcome.

## Tech

It runs entirely on native client-side rendered JavaScript.
